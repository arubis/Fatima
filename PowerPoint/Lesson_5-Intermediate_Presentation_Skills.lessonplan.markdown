## Abstract ##

Having spent a few days on technical instruction with PowerPoint, students now have a rich variety of tools at their disposal. Just as a new carpenter must learn to draw plans and refine his technique, it's now time to learn more about presenting itself.

 * Demonstrate understanding of what background information is, where it belongs, and why to include it in presentations
 * Demonstrate understanding of three common types of formal presentations
   * instructional
   * informational
   * persuasive
 * Demonstrate understanding of preparatory techniques for improving presentations, and why to use them
 * Demonstrate understanding of basic audience management

## Materials ##

 * Blackboard & Chalk
 * A good set of lungs -- lots of talking for this one

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Having spent a few days on technical instruction with PowerPoint, students now have a rich variety of tools at their disposal. Just as a new carpenter must learn to draw plans and refine his technique, it&#8217;s now time to learn more about presenting itself.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>On completion of this lesson, students will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Demonstrate understanding of what background information is, where it belongs, and why to include it in presentations</li>
<li>Demonstrate understanding of three common types of formal presentations</li>
<li>instructional</li>
<li>informational</li>
<li>persuasive</li>
<li>Demonstrate understanding of preparatory techniques for improving presentations, and why to use them</li>
<li>Demonstrate understanding of basic audience management</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>

<ul>
<li>Blackboard &amp; Chalk</li>
<li>A good set of lungs &#8211; lots of talking for this one</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>You now know how to create a very advanced PowerPoint file, with text, pictures, effects, and transitions. That means you&#8217;ve got a very powerful set of tools to use on the computer. But a good presentation is much more than what you show your audience on the computer. Today we&#8217;re going to talk about how to make your presentations more powerful, both by planning them in advance and by getting your audience more interested.</p>

<h2 id="lecture">Lecture</h2>

<h3 id="backgroundinformation">Background Information</h3>

<p>Alright, let&#8217;s go alllllll the way back to our first lesson on presentations. Can someone tell me the basic outline for a presentation?</p>

<p><em>Let the class come up with this. We&#8217;re looking for:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Topic / Theme</li>
<li>Steps / Topics</li>
<li>Last Step / Closing Topic</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
<li>Q&amp;A</li>
</ul>

<p>Good! That served us well for the first few weeks, but since we&#8217;ve had more practice with presentations, it&#8217;s time to add a little more information.</p>

<p>When you present to an audience, you have to make some assumptions about what they already know. Do you know what an <em>assumption</em> is? <em>(Define if necessary)</em> For example, when I prepare a lesson for this class, I assume that my audience &#8211; that&#8217;s you &#8211; knows English, has used a computer before, is familiar with Windows, and has been in all my prior classes. Information that you <em>assume</em> the audience knows, you do not have to present. For example, if you were presenting about human bones in biology class, you could <em>assume</em> that, since it&#8217;s a biology class, your audience knows that humans have bones that support their bodies, so you don&#8217;t have to tell them that.</p>

<p>Sometimes, though, you need to quickly catch your audience up on some basic information that they may or may not know before you get to your main presentation. This is all the information that sits <em>behind</em> your presentation, supporting it. For some people in the audience, you might be telling them something they already know, but you can&#8217;t assume that <em>everyone</em> in your audience knows it. Many of you have already done this &#8211; for example, when presenting about cooking domoda, before jumping right to the steps, you&#8217;ve talked about what domoda is, what ingredients go into it and why it&#8217;s good. That&#8217;s helpful, because while most of your classmates know what goes into domoda, I didn&#8217;t &#8211; and I&#8217;m part of the audience!</p>

<p>This part of the presentation is called the <em>Background.</em> Usually, it will come after the <em>Introduction</em> and <em>Topic or Theme</em>, and before the <em>Steps or Topics,</em> if you&#8217;re using the outline we&#8217;ve been working with already.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>BACKGROUND:</em> part of the presentation near the beginning that:</p>

<ul>
<li>contains information that you cannot assume the entire audience already knows, and that</li>
<li>the audience will need to understand the rest of the presentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Normally, the <em>Background</em> will be included after the <em>Topic</em> or <em>Theme.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In future presentations, you&#8217;ll be expected to include <em>Background</em> information, so make sure to add this to your notes!</p>

<h3 id="definingtypesofformalpresentations">Defining Types of Formal Presentations</h3>

<p>Up until now, we&#8217;ve divided presentations into two categories, or types: <strong>Informal</strong> and <strong>Formal</strong> &#8211; and said that we&#8217;re focusing on <strong>Formal</strong> presentations. That&#8217;s still the case. Within <strong>Formal</strong> presentations, though, there&#8217;s several different general types of presentations. We&#8217;ve already used them in this class; it&#8217;s time to give them names. There are many different ways to build a formal presentation. Today, we&#8217;ll go over the three most common ones.</p>

<h4 id="instructionalpresentations">Instructional Presentations</h4>

<p>Our favorite example, presenting <em>How To Cook Domoda,</em> is a set of steps in order that tell someone how to do something. It <em>instructs</em> them. This is an <em>INSTRUCTIONAL</em> presentation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>INSTRUCTIONAL</em> presentation: used to <em>instruct</em> &#8211; that is, share a series of steps that accomplish a task.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you tell me what the outline looks like for an <em>INSTRUCTIONAL</em> presentation?</p>

<p><em>Let the class come up with this. We&#8217;re looking for:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Background</li>
<li>Topic</li>
<li>Steps</li>
<li>Last Step</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
<li>Q&amp;A</li>
</ul>

<p>Other examples of <em>INSTRUCTIONAL</em> presentations:</p>

<ul>
<li>How to Travel to Kombo</li>
<li>How to dial a number on your mobile</li>
<li>Can you think of more?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="informationalpresentations">Informational Presentations</h4>

<p>Some presentations, like a history or a biology lesson, share a set of facts with the audience. These presentations don&#8217;t want the audience to do anything but learn: they don&#8217;t teach <em>how</em> to do something, or <em>why</em> to do something. They just share information. These are <em>INFORMATIONAL</em> presentations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>INFORMATIONAL</em> presentation: used to <em>inform</em> &#8211; that is, share information about
something, not necessarily how or why to do something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if we just wanted to share information, how would we organize it? Can you think of
what an outline would look like for an <em>INFORMATIONAL</em> presentation?</p>

<p><em>Let the class come up with this. We&#8217;re looking for:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>title / introduction</li>
<li>topic</li>
<li>background</li>
<li>facts and information in relevant order</li>
<li>conclusion</li>
<li>Q&amp;A</li>
</ul>

<p>What do we mean by &#8220;relevant order?&#8221; Just whatever is the best fit for your presentation. For example, in a history lesson, you might present events (&#8220;facts&#8221;) chronologically &#8211; that is, in the order of time, from longest ago to most recent. Or, in a biology lesson about bones, you could talk first about the arms, then the legs, then the bones of the torso, then the head. Or you could use another order.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll have to use your common sense. Of course, we&#8217;re happy to help if you need it!</p>

<h4 id="persuasivepresentations">Persuasive Presentations</h4>

<p>Lastly, some presentations aren&#8217;t meant just to share information or how to do something. Some presentations are designed to <em>convince</em> you to do something. The hope of the presenter is that, after an audience has seen their presentation, some or all of the people from that audience will not just remember the information, but take action. These presentations are meant to <em>convince,</em> or <em>persuade.</em> They are <em>PERSUASIVE</em> presentations.</p>

<p>Good <em>persuasive</em> presentations are exciting, because they can <em>cause real change</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>PERSUASIVE</em> presentation: used to <em>persuade</em> &#8211; that is, convince someone to <em>DO</em> something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The outline for a <em>persuasive</em> presentation is still very similar to the other outlines
we&#8217;ve used so far. Can you think of what an outline would look like to convince someone
to do something?</p>

<p><em>Let the class start this, but they&#8217;re likely to need help. We&#8217;re introducing new terms here.</em></p>

<p><em>We&#8217;ll start with:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Title/Introduction</li>
<li>Theme</li>
<li>Background</li>
<li>(something &#8211; tell class we&#8217;ll come back to this!)</li>
<li>Conclusion (yes, but this also changes a little&#8230;)</li>
<li>Q &amp; A</li>
</ul>

<p>Great! As you can see, a <em>persuasive</em> presentation already has a lot in common with the outlines
we&#8217;ve used already. There&#8217;s just a few things we have to add:</p>

<ul>
<li>title/introduction</li>
<li>theme</li>
<li>background</li>
<li>facts, points, or arguments</li>
<li>conclusion &amp; call to action</li>
<li>Q&amp;A</li>
</ul>

<p>&#8212; TODO: complete this section &amp; continue!</p>

<ol>
<li>Preparatory techniques &#8211; practice, prep for problems</li>
<li>Audience management

<ul>
<li>Eye contact</li>
<li>Call for volunteers</li>
<li>Ask questions</li>
<li>Any suggestions?</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

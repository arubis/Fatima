## Abstract ##

Having seen and experienced planning and delivering a formal presentation using PowerPoint, students will learn to add media (photos, etc) to their presentations -- and why they would do so.

## Goals ##

On completion of this lesson, students will:

* Demonstrate knowledge of adding clipart and external pictures to a slide
* Demonstrate understanding of the value media can add to -- or take away from -- their presentations

## Materials ##

* Blackboard & Chalk
* Dedicated computer for teaching purposes with PowerPoint installed
* Sufficient computers for students
* Prepared PowerPoint presentation: [Media Presentation][]

[Media Presentation]: Lesson_4_Examples/Media_Presentation.ppt

## Introduction ##

Last time, you practiced presenting to the rest of the class using PowerPoint to support you, and did a great job.  We'll do a lot more presenting in future classes, but before we get to that, let's talk about some features in PowerPoint that can make your presentations a lot more exciting and attractive.

## Lecture ##

When we talk about PowerPoint, we describe it as "presentation software," but that's really a short description for it.  A longer way to describe PowerPoint is as "multimedia presentation software."  We've already discussed what a presentation is, and you know about software -- but what's multimedia?

*Prompt class for answers; they may already know! Otherwise...*

### Terminology: Multimedia ###

_Multimedia_ comes from two words: _multi-_ and _media._
Let's take this apart.  Can you think of other words in English that start
with _multi-_?
> *Examples*:  
> Multiple (like "multiple choice")  
> Multicultural  
> Multimillionaire  
> Multiplication ("to make many")  

What's in common here?  In every case, _multi-_ means "many."
Something that is "multicultural" is made from many cultures.
A "multimillionaire" is so rich he has many millions.
And when you multiply something, you make it many.  

Now, what about _media?_  That's a little more complicated.  

_Media_ is the plural form of "medium," which can mean many things.
Here, we're using "medium" to mean "a way or method."
For example, if you are reading about science, you are learning using a
book; the "medium" is text.  If you tell a friend when the next football
match is happening, you're communicating using the "medium" of speech. 

So if "medium" is "a way or method," then _media_ is "ways or methods." 
  
*This is a complicated concept, so spend some time on understanding.*  

Let's put it together: _multi-_ is "many" and _media_ is "ways or methods."  
So: **_Multimedia_ means "many ways or methods."**

Now that we know what _multimedia_ means, what is a _multimedia presentation?_ 

*Let the students try to work this out. If necessary:*

A _multimedia presentation_ is a presentation using many ways or methods.  Some of these ways or methods -- _media_ -- include text, speech, music, effects, pictures, and video.  PowerPoint is "multimedia presentation software" because it lets you built presentations using many different kinds of _media_.

next steps:

- why use multimedia?
- what we're doing today: adding clip art, pictures and backgrounds
- what graphics can do
  - the good
  - the bad

# Lesson 4-Adding Media to PowerPoint #

## Abstract ##

Having seen and experienced planning and delivering a formal presentation using PowerPoint, students will learn to add media (photos, etc) to their presentations -- and why they would do so.

## Goals ##

On completion of this lesson, students will:

* Demonstrate knowledge of adding clipart and external pictures to a slide
* Demonstrate understanding of the value media can add to -- or take away from -- their presentations

## Materials ##

* Blackboard & Chalk
* Dedicated computer for teaching purposes with PowerPoint installed
* Sufficient computers for students
* Prepared PowerPoint presentation: [Media Presentation][]

[Media Presentation]: Lesson_4_Examples/Media_Presentation.ppt

## Introduction ##

Last time, you practiced presenting to the rest of the class using PowerPoint to support you, and did a great job.  We'll do a lot more presenting in future classes, but before we get to that, let's talk about some features in PowerPoint that can make your presentations a lot more exciting and attractive.

## Lecture ##

When we talk about PowerPoint, we describe it as "presentation software," but that's really a short description for it.  A longer way to describe PowerPoint is as "multimedia presentation software."  We've already discussed what a presentation is, and you know about software -- but what's multimedia?

*Prompt class for answers; they may already know! Otherwise...*

### Terminology: Multimedia ###

_Multimedia_ comes from two words: _multi-_ and _media._
Let's take this apart.  Can you think of other words in English that start
with _multi-_?
> *Examples*:  
> Multiple (like "multiple choice")  
> Multicultural  
> Multimillionaire  
> Multiplication ("to make many")  

What's in common here?  In every case, _multi-_ means "many."
Something that is "multicultural" is made from many cultures.
A "multimillionaire" is so rich he has many millions.
And when you multiply something, you make it many.  

Now, what about _media?_  That's a little more complicated.  

_Media_ is the plural form of "medium," which can mean many things.
Here, we're using "medium" to mean "a way or method."
For example, if you are reading about science, you are learning using a
book; the "medium" is text.  If you tell a friend when the next football
match is happening, you're communicating using the "medium" of speech. 

So if "medium" is "a way or method," then _media_ is "ways or methods." 
  
*This is a complicated concept, so spend some time on understanding.*  

Let's put it together: _multi-_ is "many" and _media_ is "ways or methods."  
So: **_Multimedia_ means "many ways or methods."**

Now that we know what _multimedia_ means, what is a _multimedia presentation?_ 

*Let the students try to work this out. If necessary:*

A _multimedia presentation_ is a presentation using many ways or methods.  Some of these ways or methods -- _media_ -- include text, speech, music, effects, pictures, and video.  PowerPoint is "multimedia presentation software" because it lets you built presentations using many different kinds of _media_.

### Why use multimedia? ###

_Or: Why Do We Care?_

PowerPoint is a tool for creating multimedia presentations -- presentations that can show information in many different ways, like speech, text, video, and pictures.  Why would you want to do that?

*(Let the class come up with ideas first)*

Different people think and learn in different ways.  Some people learn and understand better when they hear things, others when they read them, and others when they see them.

By using a multimedia approach to presenting, you can make sure everyone has something they'll understand.

Also, using many different kinds of media -- changing between speech and text and graphics -- keeps your audience interested and not bored.

### Adding Graphics: Clip Art, Pictures, and Backgrounds ###

Today, we'll discuss adding graphics -- that is, pictures -- to your presentation.  There's a few different ways to put graphics in your presentation: using Clip Art, adding from a file, and using a background image or design.

#### Adding Clip Art ####

Let's say that you have PowerPoint open and have created a slide, but it's not very interesting.  You want to make the slide more interesting with a graphic because all there is now is black text on a white background.

![Boring Slide][]

The simplest way to add a graphic or image is using Clip Art.  To do that, click on the Insert menu tab, then bring the mouse to Picture -> Clip Art.

![Add Clipart 1][]

This will open a window showing many different kinds of pictures.  Search around using the mouse to find one you like, or search using the "search for clips" field.

![Add Clipart 2][]

When you're done, _double-click_ on the image you like.  Now you've got an image on your slide -- much more interesting, isn't it?

![Clipart Added][]

But the picture here is very small, and there's lots of extra space on the slide.  Let's _resize_ the picture to be bigger.  To do that, first, click _once_ on the picture so that small squares appear at its corners.

![Select Image][]

Then, take the mouse and put the tip of the pointer right in one of the squares, then click and hold down the left mouse button.  While you're holding the button, drag the mouse to move the square shape out, making the box bigger.

![Drag Border][]

When the box is the size you want your picture to be, let go of the mouse button, and it will resize.  If you need to, you can also click in the _middle_ of the image and drag it around to move it on the slide.

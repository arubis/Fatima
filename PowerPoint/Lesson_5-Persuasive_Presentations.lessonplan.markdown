# Lesson 5-Persuasive Presentations #

## Abstract ##

Having spent a few days on technical instruction with PowerPoint, students now have a rich variety of tools at their disposal. Just as a new carpenter must learn to draw plans and refine his technique, it's now time to learn more about presenting itself.  Today we'll discuss the persuasive presentation (my favorite!).

## Goals ##

On completion of this lesson, students will:

 * 

## Materials ##

 * Blackboard & Chalk
 * A good set of lungs -- lots of talking for this one

## Introduction ##

So far, we've discussed a few kinds of structured, formal presentations without giving names to them.  Let's review them briefly, then give them names.

### Defining Types of Formal Presentations ###

Up until now, we've divided presentations into two categories, or types: **Informal** and **Formal** -- and said that we're focusing on **Formal** presentations.  That's still the case.  Within **Formal** presentations, though, there's several different general types of presentations.  We've already used them in this class; it's time to give them names.  There are many different ways to build a formal presentation.  Today, we'll go over the three most common ones.  Let's start with the two we've been using the most.

#### Instructional Presentations ####

Our favorite example, presenting _How To Cook Domoda,_ is a set of steps in order that tell someone how to do something.  It _instructs_ them.  This is an _INSTRUCTIONAL_ presentation.

> _INSTRUCTIONAL_ presentation: used to _instruct_ -- that is, share a series of steps that accomplish a task.

Can you tell me what the outline looks like for an _INSTRUCTIONAL_ presentation?

_Let the class come up with this.  We're looking for:_

* Introduction
* Background
* Topic
* Steps
* Last Step
* Conclusion
* Q&A

Other examples of _INSTRUCTIONAL_ presentations:

* How to Travel to Kombo
* How to dial a number on your mobile
* Can you think of more?

In an _INSTRUCTIONAL_ presentation, a PowerPoint slideshow is a document; that is, it can probably stand on its own.  You could probably replace it with a written report.

#### Informational Presentations ####

Some presentations, like a history or a biology lesson, share a set of facts with the audience.  These presentations don't want the audience to do anything but learn: they don't teach _how_ to do something, or _why_ to do something.  They just share information.  These are _INFORMATIONAL_ presentations.

> _INFORMATIONAL_ presentation: used to _inform_ -- that is, share information about 
> something, not necessarily how or why to do something.

So, if we just wanted to share information, how would we organize it? Can you think of
what an outline would look like for an _INFORMATIONAL_ presentation?

_Let the class come up with this. We're looking for:_

* title / introduction
* topic
* background
* facts and information in relevant order
* conclusion
* Q&A

What do we mean by "relevant order?" Just whatever is the best fit for your presentation.  For example, in a history lesson, you might present events ("facts") chronologically -- that is, in the order of time, from longest ago to most recent.  Or, in a biology lesson about bones, you could talk first about the arms, then the legs, then the bones of the torso, then the head.  Or you could use another order.

You'll have to use your common sense.  Of course, we're happy to help if you need it!

In an _INFORMATIONAL_ presentation, some presenters will not have a _core message,_ but it's best that you do -- audiences will forget most of your presentation, so focus on one thing you want them to remember!

* * * 

Good!  That's two major kinds of formal, structured presentations.  But there's one very important type that we haven't gone over, though you've started to use it in some of your presentations already.

### Advertisement Example ###

Let's talk about advertisements.  How do advertisements work?


## Lecture ##

#### Persuasive Presentations ####

Some presentations are designed to _convince_ you to do something.  The hope of the presenter is that, after an audience has seen their presentation, some or all of the people from that audience will not just remember the information, but take action.  These presentations are meant to _convince,_ or _persuade._ They are _PERSUASIVE_ presentations.

Good _persuasive_ presentations are exciting, because they can _cause real change_.

> _PERSUASIVE_ presentation: used to _persuade_ -- that is, convince someone to _DO_ something.

The outline for a _persuasive_ presentation is still very similar to the other outlines 
we've used so far.  Can you think of what an outline would look like to convince someone
to do something?

_Let the class start this, but they're likely to need help. We're introducing new terms here._

_We'll start with:_

* Title/Introduction
* Theme
* Background
* (something -- tell class we'll come back to this!)
* Conclusion (yes, but this also changes a little...)
* Q & A

Great!  As you can see, a _persuasive_ presentation already has a lot in common with the outlines
we've used already.  There's just a few things we have to add:

* title/introduction
* theme
* background
* facts, points, stories, arguments
* conclusion & call to action
* Q&A

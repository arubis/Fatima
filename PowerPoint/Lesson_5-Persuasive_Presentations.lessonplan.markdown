# Lesson 5-Persuasive Presentations #

## Abstract ##

Having spent a few days on technical instruction with PowerPoint, students now have a rich variety of tools at their disposal. Just as a new carpenter must learn to draw plans and refine his technique, it's now time to learn more about presenting itself.  Today we'll discuss the persuasive presentation (my favorite!), and learn how to start planning such a presentation.

## Goals ##

On completion of this lesson, students will:

 * Grasp the advertisement as a ready example of persuasive presentations
 * Know the three elements of an effective persuasive presentation:
	 * Core Message -- the absolute central point
	 * Stories -- why do we care?
	 * Call to Action -- what should we do?
 * Demonstrate understanding of brainstorming using the web technique for idea
   generation and refinement

## Materials ##

 * Blackboard & Chalk
 * A good set of lungs -- lots of talking for this one

## Introduction ##

So far, we've discussed a few kinds of structured, formal presentations without giving names to them.  Let's review them briefly, then give them names.

### Defining Types of Formal Presentations ###

Up until now, we've divided presentations into two categories, or types: **Informal** and **Formal** -- and said that we're focusing on **Formal** presentations.  That's still the case.  Within **Formal** presentations, though, there's several different general types of presentations.  We've already used them in this class; it's time to give them names.  There are many different ways to build a formal presentation.  Today, we'll go over the three most common ones.  Let's start with the two we've been using the most.

#### Instructional Presentations ####

Our favorite example, presenting _How To Cook Domoda,_ is a set of steps in order that tell someone how to do something.  It _instructs_ them.  This is an _INSTRUCTIONAL_ presentation.

> _INSTRUCTIONAL_ presentation: used to _instruct_ -- that is, share a series of steps that accomplish a task.

Can you tell me what the outline looks like for an _INSTRUCTIONAL_ presentation?

_Let the class come up with this.  We're looking for:_

* Introduction
* Background
* Topic
* Steps
* Last Step
* Conclusion
* Q&A

Other examples of _INSTRUCTIONAL_ presentations:

* How to Travel to Kombo
* How to dial a number on your mobile
* Can you think of more?

In an _INSTRUCTIONAL_ presentation, a PowerPoint slideshow is a document; that is, it can probably stand on its own.  You could probably replace it with a written report.

#### Informational Presentations ####

Some presentations, like a history or a biology lesson, share a set of facts with the audience.  These presentations don't want the audience to do anything but learn: they don't teach _how_ to do something, or _why_ to do something.  They just share information.  These are _INFORMATIONAL_ presentations.

> _INFORMATIONAL_ presentation: used to _inform_ -- that is, share information about 
> something, not necessarily how or why to do something.

So, if we just wanted to share information, how would we organize it? Can you think of
what an outline would look like for an _INFORMATIONAL_ presentation?

_Let the class come up with this. We're looking for:_

* title / introduction
* topic
* background
* facts and information in relevant order
* conclusion
* Q&A

What do we mean by "relevant order?" Just whatever is the best fit for your presentation.  For example, in a history lesson, you might present events ("facts") chronologically -- that is, in the order of time, from longest ago to most recent.  Or, in a biology lesson about bones, you could talk first about the arms, then the legs, then the bones of the torso, then the head.  Or you could use another order.

You'll have to use your common sense.  Of course, we're happy to help if you need it!

In an _INFORMATIONAL_ presentation, some presenters will not have a _core message,_ but it's best that you do -- audiences will forget most of your presentation, so focus on one thing you want them to remember!

* * * 

Good!  That's two major kinds of formal, structured presentations.  But there's one very important type that we haven't gone over, though you've started to use it in some of your presentations already.

## Lecture ##

### Advertisement Example ###

Advertisements are all presentations of the kind we're about to discuss.  So, before we talk about the third kind of presentation, let's talk about advertisements.

What are some advertisements that you've heard and remembered?

> As of this writing, good examples are:  
> Comium FREE boNANzaaaaaaa (over and over and over on Bwiam FM all day)  
> Gamcel's Nopal credit promotion  
> Adverts for futböl games
> …more?  Get 'em from students!

Very good! There's three things that all advertisements have in common:

1. All advertisements want your time or money.  
   More specifically, they want you to hear their *call* and take an *action*
   -- which is to go out and give them your money in exchange for their goods
   or services.  
   This is what we call a **CALL TO ACTION.**
2. All advertisements want you to remember something -- and the ones you'll
   remember want you to remember _just one thing._  
   Memorable advertisements, ones that you hear and then think of days or weeks
   later, are memorable because they have a single message that their center, 
   or _core,_ that is more important than anything else in the advertisement.
   In fact, if you forget everything else in the advertisement and remember
   only that one message, the advertisement is a success.  
   This is what we call a **CORE MESSAGE.**
3. Good advertisements, ones that you will find interesting or memorable, 
   are not just boring lists of facts.  They tell you about their core
   message using **STORIES.**  
   Advertisements are all very short, so they have to keep their stories short,
   too -- usually just a few sentences.  For example, in the Comium Free 
   Bonanza advertisement, a woman talks about how she herself can now make 
   free calls all day and every day.  

   Tell me, what is more _interesting_ and _memorable:_

     * "If you dial 166 on your mobile after charging with a card, we will
       credit the relevant account with 100 minutes; note, however, that those
       minutes will expire after five days.  Terms and conditions apply."

   Or:

     * "Now I can communicate for free all day and every day!"
   
   The best way to push your **CORE MESSAGE** toward an effective 
   **CALL TO ACTION** is by using **STORIES.**

   This is like half of a conversation: the advertiser tells you about their
   core message.  You ask, "why do I care?" and they answer with stories.
   Then you say, "okay, what should I do?" and they answer with a call to
   action.

So, advertisements are all designed to convince or *persuade* you to do something (give them your time or money).  All advertisements are of the third kind of presentation we'll be discussing here.  And that is the:

#### Persuasive Presentations ####

Some presentations are designed to _convince_ you to do something.  The hope of the presenter is that, after an audience has seen their presentation, some or all of the people from that audience will not just remember the information, but take action.  These presentations are meant to _convince,_ or _persuade._ They are _PERSUASIVE_ presentations.

Good _persuasive_ presentations are exciting, because they can _cause real change_.

> _PERSUASIVE_ presentation: used to _persuade_ -- that is, convince someone to _DO_ something.

As we've just discussed, _persuasive presentations_ have three important elements: the **CORE MESSAGE,** the **CALL TO ACTION,** and **STORIES** to help your audience connect to you.  And these are more important than being strict and staying exactly with an outline like we've been doing with _informational_ and _instructional_ presentations.  However, we can still use a general outline to suggest a structure while we get used to planning, designing, and delivering _persuasive_ presentations.

##### Outlining Persuasive Presentations #####

The outline for a persuasive presentation is still very similar to the other outlines 
we've used so far.  Can you think of what an outline would look like to convince someone
to do something?

_Let the class start this, but they're likely to need help. We're introducing new terms here._

_We'll start with:_

* Title/Introduction
* Theme
* Background
* (something -- tell class we'll come back to this!)
* Conclusion (yes, but this also changes a little...)
* Q & A

Great!  As you can see, a persuasive presentation already has a lot in common with the outlines
we've used already.  There's just a few things we have to add:

* title/introduction
* theme
* background
* facts, points, stories, arguments
* conclusion & call to action
* Q&A

So, for a persuasive presentation, you would introduce yourself and your subject, present facts, points, stories, and arguments that support your core message (three is a good number), then pull everything back together, to call to action your audience -- maybe to give you their money, maybe to protect themselves from HIV/AIDS by abstaining from sexual contact, maybe to plant cashew trees this season.

The trouble is, while the outline describes the order that you would present a persuasive presentation, it doesn't fit with the way you have to _plan_ your persuasive presentation.

##### Planning a Persuasive Presentation #####

Like we discussed earlier, a good, effective persuasive presentation has three elements:

   * Core Message -- the absolute central point
   * Stories -- why do we care?
   * Call to Action -- what should we do?

We need to plan these elements before we worry about the outline.

The first thing to do is to figure out your core message, your absolute central point, the one thing that you want your audience to remember if they forget everything else you say (and they often _will_ forget everything else that you say).

Once you've determined your core message, you decide on your Call to Action -- what is it that you want your audience to do?  Sometimes this is obvious; if you're advertising a product, you want your audience to go out and buy it.

Finally, you need to determine what stories will support your core message.  The best sort are personal: if you're discussing malaria, and you spend two minutes telling your audience the statistics for survival of untreated malaria, then talk about how studies show that using a treated bed net can help to reduce your risk of contracting malaria -- you've just put your audience to sleep.  If, on the other hand, you use those same two minutes to tell the audience about a friend of yours who was very healthy, and slept without a bed net every night, and then in just a few days they caught malaria and were very very very sick and maybe even died, and they would have been okay if they'd used a treated bed net -- well, now your audience is paying attention!

Only after you've done all of that do you worry about fitting it to an outline.

In the time we have left today, we're going to talk about the first part of all this: deciding on your **CORE MESSAGE.**

##### Deciding on your Core Message #####

No matter what theme you're presenting on (and often this will be assigned), you'll first need to sit down and think of what your core message is.  That is to say, what is the absolute central point of your presentation?  What can your audience not forget?

Your core message may not always be obvious, and having something simple is best.  For example, if your core message is that malaria kills, that's not very specific or interesting.  Or if your core message is that malaria kills and you can prevent it by killing mosquitoes or by stopping them from breeding in the first place or by taking chemopropholaxis, and that sleeping under a treated bed net helps, and that if you get malaria you can treat it with Coartem but it's very dangerous if you're pregnant, and by the way if you're pregnant you need to sleep under a treated bed net and take two doses of Fansidar...you see that this is too long, that it isn't a central point but is many many points, and your audience is going to forget all of it.

<h1 id="lesson5-addingtransitionsandcustomanimationtopowerpoint">Lesson 5-Adding Transitions and Custom Animation to PowerPoint</h1>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Now that students have learned to make their presentations into multimedia presentations by adding clip art, photos, and design templates, we&#8217;ll discuss making presentations more attention-grabbing using transitions and custom animations&#8211;and caution against their overuse.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> <em>Most of this lesson is contained within an external file, <a href="Lesson_5_Examples/Working_with_Transitions_and_Animation.PPT">Working with Transitions and Animation</a>.PPT.  Make sure to review this file and have it available before the lesson!</em></p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>On completion of this lesson, students will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Demonstrate the learned ability to add transitions to their presentations</li>
<li>Demonstrate the learned ability to add custom animation to their presentations</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>

<ul>
<li>Blackboard &amp; Chalk</li>
<li>Sufficient computing facilities for students</li>
<li>Dedicated computer for instruction</li>
<li>Prepared PowerPoint presentation: <a href="Lesson_5_Examples/Working_with_Transitions_and_Animation.PPT">Working with Transitions and Animation</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>By adding pictures, clip art, and design templates to our presentations, we made them look better and more interesting. Also, we can now use pictures to make points instead of words, which can sometimes be more useful.</p>

<p>In this lesson, we&#8217;ll discuss adding motion and effects to your presentation using <em>Transitions</em> and <em>Custom Animation.</em> Much like adding images, <em>Transitions</em> and <em>Custom Animation</em> can be fun, and call attention to your presentations, but you must be careful not to distract your audience from the content you&#8217;re presenting.  As fun as your effects may be, the biggest goal is to convince your audience of your main point.</p>

<h2 id="lecture">Lecture</h2>

<p><em>This lecture is contained within the <a href="Lesson_5_Examples/Working_with_Transitions_and_Animation.PPT">Working with Transitions and Animation</a> PowerPoint presentation.</em></p>

<h2 id="practical">Practical</h2>

<p>Now that we&#8217;ve discussed how to add a <em>Transition</em> and <em>Custom Animation,</em> try it yourself! Create a slide with at least one <em>Transition</em> and at least one <em>Custom Animation.</em>  When you&#8217;re done, please raise your hand so we can share it with the class.  </p>

<p>You can use either a new slide or one in a presentation you&#8217;ve been working with before. After next class, we&#8217;re all going to start with new blank presentations again.</p>

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>

<p>Assessment occurs when student groups show their transition- and custom animation-enabled slide to the instructor and the class.  Make sure to give positive feedback for any efforts, as well as constructive feedback on places to grow.</p>

<h2 id="closure">Closure</h2>

<p>Now, you can think of a topic, outline a presentation program, change that outline into a PowerPoint presentation, and then make your PowerPoint more interesting using pictures, ClipArt, design templates, <em>Transitions,</em> and <em>Custom Animations.</em> That&#8217;s great! You have everything you need for a basic PowerPoint presentation that will capture your audience&#8217;s attention.</p>

<p>Next time, we&#8217;ll start discussing Intermediate Presentation Skills, so between now and the next class, try to think of something you want to convince your class to do.</p>

<h2 id="extensionwork">Extension Work</h2>

<p>Students that have extra time at the end of this lesson should be instructed to explore using <em>Path Animation</em> (in the <em>Custom Animation</em> options) to move objects around the screen.  Point out that you could create a simple cartoon program with this technique.</p>

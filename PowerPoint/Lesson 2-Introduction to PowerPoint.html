<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Last time, we discussed the basics of formal presentations, and each of you helped to plan and present on your own.  Today, we&#8217;re going to get back to computers, and learn about PowerPoint.</p>

<p>PowerPoint is one of the applications, or programs, in the Microsoft Office suite.  Like Word or Excel, it is a tool that you can use for a specific task.  Word is used for creating and editing documents&#8211;such as reports or letters&#8211;that stand on their own.  What that means is that you can give somebody a document and let them read it, and you don&#8217;t even have to be there. </p>

<p>PowerPoint is different.  It&#8217;s used for planning, creating, and showing presentations, but it&#8217;s mostly there to support you.  What that means is that you still have to present in person.  With Word, you can just had a document to someone and walk away.  With PowerPoint, you have to be there; PowerPoint is only there to help you.</p>

<p>So, what we&#8217;ll do today is learn how to plan and create a very simple presentation using PowerPoint.  At the end of class, we&#8217;ll save that PowerPoint presentation to a file, because next class, we&#8217;re going to use them to learn how to present using PowerPoint.</p>

<h2 id="lecture">Lecture</h2>

<h3 id="reviewofbasicpresentationplanning">Review of Basic Presentation Planning</h3>

<p>Last class, we learned how to plan a formal presentation. Can anyone describe for me how you plan a formal presentation?</p>

<p><em>Looking for: outlining by dividing into parts (Intro, theme, steps for instructional presentations or topics for informational/motivational ones, conclusion/closure, q&amp;a)</em>
<em>As discussed by students, copy parts of outline to board.</em></p>

<p>Now, we&#8217;re going to plan a new presentation, just like we did last class.  This time, though, we&#8217;re going to use PowerPoint to plan it.</p>

<h3 id="powerpointoperation">PowerPoint Operation</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s start by briefly going over starting and using PowerPoint.  We&#8217;ll spend just a few minutes on this, and then move to building a presentation.</p>

<h4 id="startingpowerpoint">Starting PowerPoint</h4>

<p>In order to start or launch PowerPoint, open the Start menu by left-clicking it in the bottom-left corner of your screen, then click on Microsoft PowerPoint.  If you don&#8217;t see it, move your mouse to All Programs and see if it appears under that menu.  If PowerPoint does not appear, let me know and I&#8217;ll assist you.</p>

<h4 id="interfaceoverview">Interface Overview</h4>

<p>As you can see, like Microsoft Word and Excel, PowerPoint has a title bar, a menu bar, and a few toolbars. In the Standard Toolbar, many of the basic options are the same as in Word and Excel&#8211;the same icons to create a new document, to save your work, to open a saved file, and more. Almost everything you can do in PowerPoint can be accessed through these bars, but we&#8217;ll save most of that for future lectures.  </p>

<p>Today, we&#8217;re going to be looking at the PowerPoint outliner, the slide viewer, and the main viewer.</p>

<p><em>Define &#8220;slide(<a href="#fn:slide" id="fnref:slide" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a>)&#8221; and &#8220;slideshow(<a href="#fn:slideshow" id="fnref:slideshow" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a>)!&#8221;</em></p>

<p><strong>For this portion, need access to Windows version of PPT to provide nav instructions, get screenshots, etc.</strong></p>

<p><em>Walk students through changing between Outline and Slides view, and demonstrate that the Main view to the right remains.  Have students leave view set to Outline.</em></p>

<h2 id="practice">Practice</h2>

<p>Now that we&#8217;ve had a little look around PowerPoint, let&#8217;s get started using it!  Last class we learned how to outline a formal presentation.  PowerPoint makes turning your outline into a presentation very easy.</p>

<p>Before we start, do you all still have your outlines from last class?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s better if you use your own, but if you don&#8217;t have your outline, you can work from this example.</p>

<p><em>Copy to board:</em></p>

<p><strong>Making Domoda</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Why cook domoda?</li>
<li>Ingredients
<ul><li>Groundnuts</li>
<li>Tomato paste</li>
<li>Fish or meat</li>
<li>Vegetables</li>
<li>Palm oil</li>
<li>Rice</li></ul></li>
<li>Step 1: Pound the groundnuts
<ol><li>Put groundnuts in mortar</li>
<li>Pound with pestle</li></ol></li>
<li>Step 2: Add tomato paste</li>
<li>Step 3: Add palm oil</li>
<li>Step 4&#8230;</li>
<li>Last step: Eat and share!</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
<li>Any questions?</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, let&#8217;s put our outline into PowerPoint!  Remember, we&#8217;re just working on the outline today.  I know many of you have already started experimenting with including pictures and effects in your slides, but right now we&#8217;re just going to go over using text.</p>

<h3 id="creatingablankpresentation">Creating a Blank Presentation</h3>

<p>First, we need to create a blank presentation.  You can either click on the File&#8230; menu and select New, or, more easily, click the New Document button on the standard toolbar.</p>

<p>If a window appears asking you about creating a blank presentation, opening an existing presentation, or using a Wizard, select <em>Blank Presentation</em>.</p>

<p>Also, if a window appears asking you to select a Slide Layout, just click <strong>Cancel</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="enteringoutlinemode">Entering Outline Mode</h3>

<p>Microsoft PowerPoint lets you quickly create a presentation by typing in an outline.  Let&#8217;s do just that.</p>

<p><em>Instruct students to select Outline Mode</em></p>

<p>NOTE: Outline mode is selected using either the Slides | Outline toggle located <strong>above</strong> the Slides / Outline portion, or using the small icon with three lines located <strong>below</strong> the Slides / Outline portion, depending on your version of PowerPoint.  <em>Since versions may vary throughout the lab, make sure to check in with students to make sure they follow!</em></p>

<h3 id="addingthetitletoyourfirstslide">Adding the title to your first slide</h3>

<p>Now that we&#8217;re in Outline mode, you can see your first blank slide to the right, in the Main Viewer, and on the left, your blank Outline.  The little grey square to the left of your cursor represents the slide you&#8217;re working on.  For the first slide, type the title of your presentation.  If you&#8217;re working from the example on the board, that would be Making Domoda.</p>

<p>So, go ahead and type in your title.  When you&#8217;re done, don&#8217;t press enter or return&#8211;just leave the slide open while I come around and check your work.</p>

<p><em>Mill about; guide students through creating the first slide.</em></p>

<h3 id="usingenterreturntocreatethesecondthemetopicandthirdfirstpointstepslide">Using Enter/Return to create the second (theme/topic) and third (first point/step) slide</h3>

<p>Great! You&#8217;ve all got your first slide&#8211;your Title Slide.  This will work as your Introduction.  </p>

<p>Now, in Outline view, press Enter or Return.  In the Main Viewer you&#8217;ll see your new, second slide.  On the left, in your Outline view, you&#8217;ll see a new line labeled 2 with a new grey square&#8211;this line is for working with your second slide.</p>

<p>With your cursor at this second line, type the name of your second slide.  If you&#8217;re using the example on the board, this is Ingredients.  </p>

<p>Now you have two slides.  </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s make a third.  Press Enter or Return again, and then type the name of your third slide.  If you&#8217;re using the example on the board, that would be <em>Ingredients.</em></p>

<p>With three slides, you have almost enough for a presentation already.</p>

<h3 id="addingmoreinformationtoslides">Adding more information to slides</h3>

<p><em>Concise version: show how to add text via blank box in main viewer and via the outline pane</em></p>

<p>So now you&#8217;re on your third slide.  At the top, in the slide viewer, you can see the title of the slide.  That could be enough to present already, but what if you wanted to add more information to the slide?</p>

<p>Your new slide will have a box in the Main Viewer that says Click To Add Text.  And you can do just that!  Click in the box that says Click To Add Text, and add more information.  If you&#8217;re using the example on the board, since we&#8217;re listing ingredients, you&#8217;d want to type <em>Groundnuts.</em> If you press return, you&#8217;ll get a new line to add more information.</p>

<p>Now, look back in the Outline.  Do you see the text you just added?  It also appears in the outline, just like we created on paper last class.</p>

<p>If you click back into the Outline, you can also add more information there.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s do that.  Go back to the Outline viewer, and place your cursor at the end of the last information you added to the third slide.</p>

<p><em>Wait for students to catch up a bit.</em></p>

<p>Okay, now that you&#8217;re at the last line, press Return.  That gives you a new line on the same slide.  Since we already have our first additional line typed in &#8211; &#8220;<em>groundnuts</em>&#8221; &#8211; let&#8217;s here type in <em>Tomato Paste</em>.</p>

<p>When you&#8217;ve done that, go ahead and add any additional information you&#8217;d like for this slide, like &#8220;Fish or Meat,&#8221; &#8220;Vegetables,&#8221; and more.</p>

<p><em>Mill about and check students work.</em></p>

<p>Now, let&#8217;s add another slide to the presentation.  You can use the menu bar by going to Insert→New Slide…, but let&#8217;s try something trickier.  In Outline mode, press Return or Enter from the last line.  You get a new line in the current slide &#8211; which isn&#8217;t what we want, is it? </p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="indentingandun-indentingwithshifttab">Indenting and Un-Indenting with Shift+Tab</h4>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to change our new line into a new slide, we need to <em>Un-Indent</em> it.  And that needs some explanation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The PowerPoint outliner can make things in your presentation bigger or smaller, more or less important. <br />
The most important that thing, as far as the Outliner knows, is the title of a slide.
To make something less important &#8211; that is, to put it under something more important, like a slide title &#8211; you press <strong>Tab</strong>, the key to the left of Q on your keyboard.  When you press <strong>Tab</strong>, you will see the text under your cursor move to the right, and become smaller.  This is called <em>Indenting.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can indent something many times, making it smaller and smaller.
You can have many small things under one larger thing.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why use indenting?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Indented things can add more details to larger ideas.  For example:</p>

<p>Why eat domoda?</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
<li><p>It&#8217;s healthy!</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul><li>Groundnuts are a good source of protein</li>
<li>Palm oil is a good source of Vitamin A</li></ul>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s delicious!</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul><li>The salty-savory taste of groundnuts is great with rice</li>
<li>You can adjust the flavor with hot pepper or Jumboo</li></ul>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Just remember, your goal with PowerPoint is to <em>support</em> your presentation.
You don&#8217;t have to write everything that you&#8217;ll say!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can also tell PowerPoint to make something <em>more</em> important.  This is called <em>Un-Indenting.</em>  If you want to <em>Indent</em> something, you press <strong>Tab</strong>.  If you want to <em>Un-Indent</em> something, you press and hold <strong>Shift</strong> and then press <strong>Tab.</strong>  <a href="#fn:notation" id="fnref:notation" title="see footnote" class="footnote">3</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, to make our new line into a new slide, use <strong>Shift-Tab.</strong>  Please do that now.</p>

<p><em>Again, check students work.</em></p>

<h3 id="addingadditionalslidestocompletepresentation">Adding additional slides to complete presentation</h3>

<p>Okay, now you you know how to add a new slide.  Now, using your outline on paper or the example on the board, complete your presentation by adding slides and, when you feel you need to, more information to each slide.</p>

<p><em>Help students as needed.  This will likely take until the end of the class period.</em></p>

<h3 id="savingyourpresentationtoafile">Saving your presentation to a file</h3>

<p>Alright!  Each of you now has a PowerPoint presentation, which means you&#8217;re ready to share information with others.  For now, though, let&#8217;s make sure your work is safe.  Do you remember how to save a file to the disk?</p>

<p><em>Walk students through saving a file if necessary.</em></p>

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>

<p>As this is generally a lab-based activity, assessment can be performed in a general sense by the teacher.  Grasp on the material will be covered in future classes (open lab and presentations).</p>

<h2 id="extensionwork">Extension Work</h2>

<p>If the class completes work early, select a group and have one member present while another operates the computer.  Continue in this fashion for each group until complete or time expires.</p>

<h2 id="closure">Closure</h2>

<p><em>Congratulate the class! They&#8217;ve just made their first structured PowerPoint presentation.</em></p>

<p>Very good!  We&#8217;ll keep practicing more presenting and planning in future classes.  But right now, you can already plan, outline, and create a formal PowerPoint presentation.  That&#8217;s a great skill, and one that many people don&#8217;t have.</p>

<p>Next time, we&#8217;ll present each of these PowerPoints to the rest of the class, so remember what you&#8217;re talking about!</p>

# Lesson 3-Presenting with PowerPoint #

## Abstract ##

Having now discussed basic presentation skills, including planning and outlining a presentation on paper and using PowerPoint, students now have a chance to practice actually presenting.

## Goals ##

On completion of this lesson, students will:

 * Demonstrate understanding of basic presentation skills by presenting prior work to the class
 * Gain exposure to PowerPoint operation and its use in supporting a live presentation

## Materials ##

 * Computers sufficient for class size
	* Students should sit at the same stations as prior session
	* Need to re-open saved file from prior session containing basic presentation
  * Dedicate one computer for instructor use (aside from when that group needs to present)
  * Prepared PowerPoint presentation: [Making Pasta][] _Note: It is useful to review this before class_

[Making Pasta]: Lesson_3_Pasta_Demo.ppt

## Introduction ##

In our last class, we talked about using PowerPoint to change your presentation outline into an actual PowerPoint presentation file.  Today, we're going to put it all together: you're going to use your new presentation and PowerPoint skills to present to the class!

## Lecture ##

As a demonstration, I'll go first.  We've been using the example of cooking Domoda, so I'll present on that -- but that doesn't mean you can't do the same.

*Open [Making Pasta][] presentation.*

As you can see, I've got PowerPoint open with my presentation on the screen, set to the first slide.  This is the way PowerPoint looks when you're working on making a presentation, but we don't need anything except the main viewer when we're presenting.  You can simplify the display by starting the **Slide Show.**

*Start **Slide Show.** This can be accessed by pressing **F5** or **Alt+Enter**, or with the **Slide Show** button at the bottom of the **Outline / Slides** section, or under the menu system as **Slide Showâ†’View Slide Show**.*

*From the introduction...*

Hello, I'm ____________, and today I'm going to tell you about making pasta.

*And so on. Note that you can advance the current slide by clicking the mouse or by pressing the **Right Arrow** button.*

## Transition to Practical ##

So, that's how you present using PowerPoint.

Do any of you have any questions before it's your turn?

*Entertain questions.*

## Practical ##

Okay.  I need two volunteers from each group (*one to present, one to operate PPT*).  

Who wants to be brave and go first?  

*If necessary, choose a group.*

*Have the first group open their presentation. Instruct them to enter **Slide Show** mode, and then to begin presenting!*

*Provide guidance as needed, but minimize interruptions.*

*After first presentation:*

* Congratulate & affirm first presenters
* Ask class for suggestions
* Congratulate again, pick next group, and continue in this fashion for all groups.

*This should take the available class time.*

## Assessment ##

Since presenting itself isn't part of the syllabus, assessment will be by instructor's discretion.  It is intended that the presentations be indicative of students understanding both of presentation skills and PowerPoint use.

## Closure ##

Very good, everyone!  Did you enjoy giving your first PowerPoint presentation?

It gets much more fun from here.  We've gone over just the very basics -- black text on a white background.  In the next few classes, we'll learn more about making your PowerPoint look good using pictures and text, and more about presenting in general.

And a very special thank-you to those of you who presented.  Well done!

## Extension Work ##

If anything, it is anticipated that this lesson would run long rather than short.  If, however, you do manage to finish early, have the students begin experimenting with adding clipart to the presentations they just gave.

 * Demonstrate the ability to create a simple 5-slide presentation using PowerPoint

## Materials ##

 * Chalk

 * Microsoft PowerPoint software

## Introduction ##

Last time, we discussed the basics of formal presentations, and each of you helped to plan and present on your own.  Today, we're going to get back to computers, and learn about PowerPoint.

PowerPoint is one of the applications, or programs, in the Microsoft Office suite.  Like Word or Excel, it is a tool that you can use for a specific task.  Word is used for creating and editing documents--such as reports or letters--that stand on their own.  What that means is that you can give somebody a document and let them read it, and you don't even have to be there. 

PowerPoint is different.  It's used for planning, creating, and showing presentations, but it's mostly there to support you.  What that means is that you still have to present in person.  With Word, you can just had a document to someone and walk away.  With PowerPoint, you have to be there; PowerPoint is only there to help you.

So, what we'll do today is learn how to plan and create a very simple presentation using PowerPoint.  At the end of class, we'll save that PowerPoint presentation to a file, because next class, we're going to use them to learn how to present using PowerPoint.

## Lecture ##

### Review of Basic Presentation Planning ###

Last class, we learned how to plan a formal presentation. Can anyone describe for me how you plan a formal presentation?

*Looking for: outlining by dividing into parts (Intro, theme, steps for instructional presentations or topics for informational/motivational ones, conclusion/closure, q&a)*
*As discussed by students, copy parts of outline to board.*

Now, we're going to plan a new presentation, just like we did last class.  This time, though, we're going to use PowerPoint to plan it.

### PowerPoint Operation ###

Let's start by briefly going over starting and using PowerPoint.  We'll spend just a few minutes on this, and then move to building a presentation.

#### Starting PowerPoint ####

In order to start or launch PowerPoint, open the Start menu by left-clicking it in the bottom-left corner of your screen, then click on Microsoft PowerPoint.  If you don't see it, move your mouse to All Programs and see if it appears under that menu.  If PowerPoint does not appear, let me know and I'll assist you.

#### Interface Overview ####

As you can see, like Microsoft Word and Excel, PowerPoint has a title bar, a menu bar, and a few toolbars. In the Standard Toolbar, many of the basic options are the same as in Word and Excel--the same icons to create a new document, to save your work, to open a saved file, and more. Almost everything you can do in PowerPoint can be accessed through these bars, but we'll save most of that for future lectures.  

Today, we're going to be looking at the PowerPoint outliner, the slide viewer, and the main viewer.

*Define "slide" and "slideshow!"*

**For this portion, need access to Windows version of PPT to provide nav instructions, get screenshots, etc.**

TODO: create walkthrough. slideshow is series of "slides" -- where each slide is like a page displayed to the audience.  Main viewer shows one slide and lets you modify it.  Slide viewer shows the ordered slides; you can change the order easily, and flick through the slideshow to manipulate it.  Outliner lets you rapidly create or view the basics of your slideshow without distractions.

## Practice ##

Now that we've had a little look around PowerPoint, let's get started using it!  Last class we learned how to outline a formal presentation.  PowerPoint makes turning your outline into a presentation very easy.

Before we start, do you all still have your outlines from last class?

It's better if you use your own, but if you don't have your outline, you can work from this example.

*Copy to board*

**Making Domoda**

 * Introduction
 * Why make domoda?
 * Ingredients
 * Step 1: Pound the groundnuts
 * Step 2: Add tomato paste
 * Step 3: Add palm oil
 * Step 4...N-1
 * Last step: Eat and share!
 * Conclusion
 * Any questions?

Okay, let's put our outline into PowerPoint!

### Creating a Blank Presentation ###

First, we need to create a blank presentation.  You can either click on the File... menu and select New, or, more easily, click the New Document button on the standard toolbar.

TODO: Grab screenshots of these operations.

If a window appears asking you about creating a blank presentation, opening an existing presentation, or using a Wizard, select Blank Presentation.

### Outline Mode                                    ###
### Adding the title to your first slide            ###
### Using Enter/Return to create the second slide   ###
### Using Tab and Shift+Tab to promote/indent items ###

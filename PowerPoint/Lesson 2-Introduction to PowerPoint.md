## Introduction ##

Last time, we discussed the basics of formal presentations, and each of you helped to plan and present on your own.  Today, we're going to get back to computers, and learn about PowerPoint.

PowerPoint is one of the applications, or programs, in the Microsoft Office suite.  Like Word or Excel, it is a tool that you can use for a specific task.  Word is used for creating and editing documents--such as reports or letters--that stand on their own.  What that means is that you can give somebody a document and let them read it, and you don't even have to be there. 

PowerPoint is different.  It's used for planning, creating, and showing presentations, but it's mostly there to support you.  What that means is that you still have to present in person.  With Word, you can just had a document to someone and walk away.  With PowerPoint, you have to be there; PowerPoint is only there to help you.

So, what we'll do today is learn how to plan and create a very simple presentation using PowerPoint.  At the end of class, we'll save that PowerPoint presentation to a file, because next class, we're going to use them to learn how to present using PowerPoint.

### Review of Basic Presentation Planning ###

Last class, we learned how to plan a formal presentation. Can anyone describe for me how you plan a formal presentation?

*Looking for: outlining by dividing into parts (Intro, theme, steps for instructional presentations or topics for informational/motivational ones, conclusion/closure, q&a)*
*As discussed by students, copy parts of outline to board.*

Now, we're going to plan a new presentation, just like we did last class.  This time, though, we're going to use PowerPoint to plan it.

### PowerPoint Operation ###

Let's start by briefly going over starting and using PowerPoint.  We'll spend just a few minutes on this, and then move to building a presentation.

#### Starting PowerPoint ####

In order to start or launch PowerPoint, open the Start menu by left-clicking it in the bottom-left corner of your screen, then click on Microsoft PowerPoint.  If you don't see it, move your mouse to All Programs and see if it appears under that menu.  If PowerPoint does not appear, let me know and I'll assist you.

#### Interface Overview ####


*Define "slide" and "slideshow!"*

### Transition to Practical ###

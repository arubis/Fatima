# Lesson 1-Basic Presentation Skills #

## Abstract ##

As a precursor to talking about Microsoft PowerPoint—that being software used to support presentations—we first have to talk about presentations in a formal setting.

## Goals ##

On completion of this lesson, students will:

 * Be exposed to a structured presentation format with support material
 * Demonstrate proficiency at planning the structure of a presentation
 * Demonstrate proficiency at presenting a planned, structured presentation

## Materials ##

 * Blackboard
 * Chalk

## Introduction ##

You've now had a chance to spend time playing with Microsoft PowerPoint, and to become familiar with its interface—the buttons and menus, the clip art, the transitions.  But what's it all for?  PowerPoint, like Word and Excel, is a software program, a tool, with a specific purpose.  Do you know what that purpose is?  

Drive conversation toward: PowerPoint is a tool for creating structured presentations.  

Discuss presentations: who's had to present at the board before? Given an oral report? Showed another student how to do something? Formal vs. informal, etc.

Who usually gives presentations, where, and why?

Informal, unstructured presentations can be anything! You explaining to your classmates how to do a maths problem is a form of informal presentation.

Structured presentations are planned in advance, so they have an agenda, or schedule, or list of things to cover, and shouldn't jump into other topics.  They also have a beginning, a middle, and an end.

Today, we're going to explore structured presentations, because that's what PowerPoint is designed to support.

## Lecture ##

A presentation is just a way to share information: you can use it to report on something you've done, to share ideas, to instruct on how to do something, and many more.  Since I have a plan and am sharing how to formally present, this entire class is a formal presentation!  

Now that we've discussed the difference between informal and formal presentations, let's plan a formal presentation within this class.  

I really like domoda—Mariama Gassama's is very very sweet!  But I don't know how to make it.  So I'll need all of your help!

We'll start by outlining the presentation—that is, dividing it into its biggest parts.  Let's use a simple format that works for most presentations:

*Copy to board*

* Introduction  
* Topic  
* Background
* Step 1  
* Step 2  
* Steps....  
* Last Step  
* Conclusion & Closure  
* Questions  

Here, the __Introduction__ is just to introduce yourself as the speaker.  Sometimes the __Introduction__ can also include your main Topic, which is what you're talking about today, but we've saved that for the Topic section.

The __Topic__ is, as we've said, what we're talking about today.

So, for the Introduction, we don't need to plan very much!  And for the Topic, we just need to know that we're talking about Making Domoda.  That's our __Topic__: Making Domoda.

The __Background__ is where you include information the audience needs to know before you get to the main part of your presentation.  Some presentations won't even need a __Background__ section.  For example, in an instructional presentation -- like how to cook domoda -- your __Background__ would be what your audience needs before they start -- like a list of ingredients.

So, that's our __Background:__ _Ingredients._ 

Now, let's talk about the steps!

*Walk the class through outlining steps in making domoda.  Simple version is Get Ingredients, Prepare Ingredients, Cook Domoda, Pour Domoda Over Rice, Eat Domoda, Clean up—but let the students do it!  Maybe you'll discover a family recipe.*

Great!  We've got all the steps.  Now, this second to last point—Conclusion & Closure—is just an opportunity for you to wrap things up for whoever you're presenting to.  An easy way to do this is to summarize what you've just said, and remind your audience why it's important.  

And, lastly, we leave room at the end for questions, so that if your audience is left wondering about anything, you can help them to understand.  It can help if you tell your audience at the beginning that you'll have time for questions at the end, so they won't interrupt you during your presentation.  (Of course, during this class, I want to know if you have questions any time!)

So, if I wanted to tell someone how to make domoda, here's how I'd do it...

*Present using the student-created outline. Take it slow, make it simple!*

## Practice ##

Now we're going to practice planning and showing presentations.  We don't have enough time for everyone to do this, so let's form groups!

*Divide class into midsize groups.  The plan is for each to plan and present, so judge need for time and the number of groups accordingly—on first class I'm aiming for three groups.*

Now, I want each group to pick a topic and plan a very short presentation.  It can be on anything!  You could use this presentation to talk about how to make benachin, about why your favorite football team is the best (remember, you have to show evidence!), on the best way to crack groundnuts--anything you want.

And, please, let me know if you need any help!

I'll give you about (_a quarter of the remaining time_) to work on this plan.

*Mill about the classroom; guide students as needed.*

*On completion of planning period:*

Okay, I can see you've all done great work on planning your presentations!  Now, I'd like each group to pick a presenter—someone who's going to present to the rest of the class.  Make sure to bring your presentation outline, so you have a guide!

*Take volunteers! Guide each through presenting to the class.*

## Assessment ##

*Performed as a group.  Observe and guide planners and presenters in above activity.*

## Closure ##

Good work, and congratulations! When you came in here, some of you had never planned a formal presentation before.  Now, you're all ready to make and give presentations on your own!  Next class, we'll talk about how to use PowerPoint to support your formal presentations.  That means that we'll be building another presentation, so between now and then, I want you all to think of what you want to present to the class.

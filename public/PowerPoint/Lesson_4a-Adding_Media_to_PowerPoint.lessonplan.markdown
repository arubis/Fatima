# Lesson 4a-Adding Media to PowerPoint #

## Abstract ##

Having seen and experienced planning and delivering a formal presentation using PowerPoint, students will learn to add media (photos, etc) to their presentations -- and why they would do so.

## Goals ##

On completion of this lesson, students will:

* Demonstrate knowledge of adding clipart and external pictures to a slide
* Demonstrate understanding of the value media can add to -- or take away from -- their presentations

## Materials ##

* Blackboard & Chalk
* Dedicated computer for teaching purposes with PowerPoint installed
* Sufficient computers for students
* Prepared PowerPoint presentation: [Media Presentation][]

## Introduction ##

Last time, you practiced presenting to the rest of the class using PowerPoint to support you, and did a great job.  We'll do a lot more presenting in future classes, but before we get to that, let's talk about some features in PowerPoint that can make your presentations a lot more exciting and attractive.

## Lecture ##

When we talk about PowerPoint, we describe it as "presentation software," but that's really a short description for it.  A longer way to describe PowerPoint is as "multimedia presentation software."  We've already discussed what a presentation is, and you know about software -- but what's multimedia?

*Prompt class for answers; they may already know! Otherwise...*

### Terminology: Multimedia ###

_Multimedia_ comes from two words: _multi-_ and _media._
Let's take this apart.  Can you think of other words in English that start
with _multi-_?
> *Examples*:  
> Multiple (like "multiple choice")  
> Multicultural  
> Multimillionaire  
> Multiplication ("to make many")  

What's in common here?  In every case, _multi-_ means "many."
Something that is "multicultural" is made from many cultures.
A "multimillionaire" is so rich he has many millions.
And when you multiply something, you make it many.  

Now, what about _media?_  That's a little more complicated.  

_Media_ is the plural form of "medium," which can mean many things.
Here, we're using "medium" to mean "a way or method."
For example, if you are reading about science, you are learning using a
book; the "medium" is text.  If you tell a friend when the next football
match is happening, you're communicating using the "medium" of speech. 

So if "medium" is "a way or method," then _media_ is "ways or methods." 
  
*This is a complicated concept, so spend some time on understanding.*  

Let's put it together: _multi-_ is "many" and _media_ is "ways or methods."  
So: **_Multimedia_ means "many ways or methods."**

Now that we know what _multimedia_ means, what is a _multimedia presentation?_ 

*Let the students try to work this out. If necessary:*

A _multimedia presentation_ is a presentation using many ways or methods.  Some of these ways or methods -- _media_ -- include text, speech, music, effects, pictures, and video.  PowerPoint is "multimedia presentation software" because it lets you built presentations using many different kinds of _media_.

### Why use multimedia? ###

_Or: Why Do We Care?_

PowerPoint is a tool for creating multimedia presentations -- presentations that can show information in many different ways, like speech, text, video, and pictures.  Why would you want to do that?

*(Let the class come up with ideas first)*

Different people think and learn in different ways.  Some people learn and understand better when they hear things, others when they read them, and others when they see them.

By using a multimedia approach to presenting, you can make sure everyone has something they'll understand.

Also, using many different kinds of media -- changing between speech and text and graphics -- keeps your audience interested and not bored.

### Adding Graphics: Clip Art, Pictures, and Backgrounds ###

Today, we'll discuss adding graphics -- that is, pictures -- to your presentation.  There's a few different ways to put graphics in your presentation: using Clip Art, adding from a file, and using a background image or design.

#### Adding Clip Art ####

Let's say that you have PowerPoint open and have created a slide, but it's not very interesting.  You want to make the slide more interesting with a graphic because all there is now is black text on a white background.

![Boring Slide][]

The simplest way to add a graphic or image is using Clip Art.  To do that, click on the Insert menu tab, then bring the mouse to Picture -> Clip Art.

![Add Clipart 1][]

This will open a window showing many different kinds of pictures.  Search around using the mouse to find one you like, or search using the "search for clips" field.

![Add Clipart 2][]

When you're done, _double-click_ on the image you like.  Now you've got an image on your slide -- much more interesting, isn't it?

![Clipart Added][]

But the picture here is very small, and there's lots of extra space on the slide.  Let's _resize_ the picture to be bigger.  To do that, first, click _once_ on the picture so that small squares appear at its corners.

![Select Image][]

Then, take the mouse and put the tip of the pointer right in one of the squares, then click and hold down the left mouse button.  While you're holding the button, drag the mouse to move the square shape out, making the box bigger.

![Drag Border][]

When the box is the size you want your picture to be, let go of the mouse button, and it will resize.  If you need to, you can also click in the _middle_ of the image and drag it around to move it on the slide.

#### Adding Other Pictures ####

You can also add pictures and graphics from anywhere else on the computer.  This can be especially useful if you have a digital camera or access to the Internet, either of which would allow you to create or find pictures with meanings very close to what you're presenting about.

To add a picture or graphic from outside of Clip Art, use the mouse to select _Insert..._ from the menu bar, drag down to _Pictureâ†’,_ then click _From File..._.

![Select Picture... Option][]

Then, use the _Insert Picture_ window that appears to locate the picture you want to add.  For our example, I've found a picture in the _My Documents/My Pictures_ folder.  If you're familiar with where Windows stores pictures, or if you have your own source, you could of course add a picture from there.

![Select Picture File][]

Finally, click the _Insert_ button, and your picture will appear as part of your slide.

![Picture Inserted][]

If you'd like, you can resize or move the picture in the same way we did with the Clip Art.

[Picture Inserted]:			Lesson_4a_Examples/12_Other_Sources-added.PNG	width=640px

#### Adding a Design or Background ####

In addition to pictures or graphics that take part of your slide, you can also add a _Background_ or _Design Template_ that changes the look of your entire slide.  This can be a very fast way to try a new look or feel for your slides, because it is added to all of them at once.

In order to add just a background, go back to the _Insert_ tab on the menu bar, then select _Background..._.

![Background][]

We won't go over this in great detail.

To add a Design Template, use the mouse to access the _Insert_ menu, then click _Apply Design Template..._.  

> > **NOTE:** Some versions of PowerPoint instead have a _Slide Design..._ option under _Insert,_ which instead of opening the Design Template window, will open a pane to the right side.  Adjust accordingly.

![Apply Design Template][]

This will present you with a list of example Design Templates. Click on each one to preview how your slides will look.

![Select Design][]

When you've found a design you like, either double-click on its name, or select it and click on Insert.  Either way, it will be applied to all of your slides at once.

### What Graphics Can Do ###

Using graphics and pictures can be good for your presentation, but they can also make it worse if you use them in a way that is distracting or confusing.  Let's look at some examples.

#### The Good ####

When used well, a picture or graphic is simple, draws attention to what you're trying to say, increases the audience's interest, and does not confuse or distract the audience.

![The Good][]

#### The Bad ####

When used poorly, though, pictures or graphics can ruin a slide.  If there are too many images, or if they are not related to what you're saying, or if they cover your text or otherwise make it difficult to read, then pictures can do more harm than good.  

So be careful!

![The Bad][]

The same applies for Design Templates, by the way: while they often add color and interest to your slide, it's very easy to make them distracting, which makes them a problem.

## Practical ##

_Depending on time constraints, this may be split out into an additional lesson/lab period and combined with presenting. 15 minutes of practice with adding pictures should be considered minimally sufficient._

Now that we've discussed how to add graphics, pictures, backgrounds, and designs to our presentations, it's time for all of you to add graphics and pictures to your own presentations!  You can either use the presentation files you've been working with in class up to now, or create a new one if you're more comfortable with that.

_Note that this is one of the last times we'll let students use this initial presentation; it's getting a little tired.  Next class we'll add Transitions, the class following students will present, and then we start fresh with new presentation files._

## Assessment ##

In the meantime, one-on-one instruction while students are working on the Practical aspect of the lesson can help the instructor ascertain the student body's general understanding.

## Closure ##

PowerPoint is a powerful program that lets you use many different ways -- that is, _multimedia_ -- to present your ideas.  Graphics, pictures, and design templates are all great ways to grab your audience's interest and make your points more clear.  

## Extension Work ##

Have students practice adding Clip Art, Pictures, and Design Templates for 10-15 minutes.  If sufficient time remains, begin Lesson 5 by introducing Transitions and Custom Animation.  Formal instruction of using Custom Animation can wait for a future lecture be skipped altogether in favor of letting students discover on their own in a lab setting.

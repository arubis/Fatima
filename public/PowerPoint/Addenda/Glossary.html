<p>a section of your presentation where you make you and your subject known to the audience. in its most basic form: &#8220;hello, I&#8217;m <em>(your name).</em> today we&#8217;ll be talking about <em>(your topic)</em>.&#8221; there are more interesting ways to do this, also; you can use a story about your subject as your introduction, for example</p>

<dd>
<p>you can also be <em>introduced,</em> which is having someone else tell the audience who you are</p>

in a picture of a person, the <em>background</em> is everything behind the person
&#8211; trees, roads, buildings. it&#8217;s the information that surrounds, but is
not, your presentation theme. <br />

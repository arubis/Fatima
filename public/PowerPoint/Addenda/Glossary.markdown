# PowerPoint and Presentations -- Terms and Definitions #

## General Terms ##

presentation
: the demonstration or design of a product or idea
: showing someone how or why to do something
: an opportunity to share your stories with us!

slide
: One "screen" of a presentation. May include text, images, video, and a background image

slideshow
: Many slides placed in order.  Used to support a presentation.  Also called a "deck," like a deck of cards

slideware
: Software program used to make a slideshow.  Microsoft Powerpoint is the most popular

multimedia
: _Multimedia_ comes from two words: _multi-_ and _media._  Let's take this apart:
: _multi-_ means "many."
: _media_ is "ways or methods."
: so _multimedia_ is "many ways or methods."
: For example, a _multimedia presentation_ is a presentation using many media, like speaking, text, video, and sound.

animation
: the movement of things like text or images around on the screen

## Using PowerPoint ##

toolbar
: a ribbon of small picture buttons, or "icons," used to quickly access functions of a program, like saving a file

text box
: an object on a PowerPoint slide that is words, and can be moved to different parts of the slide

slide sorter
: displays many of the slides in your slideshow or deck at smaller size at the same time, letting you change their order

template
: a model slide that can be copied throughout a slideshow so that all the slides look alike.
: (a template is actually a collection of _master slides,_ but we'll get to that later in the course.)

Design Template
: a template built in to Microsoft PowerPoint. These can rapidly create a consistent "look" to your slideshow.

table
: a collection of data presented in rows and columns, like in Excel

Custom Animation
: the menu command to add animations to your slide

transition
: an effect displayed when changing from one slide to the next

Clip Art
: pictures and images build into Microsoft PowerPoint that you can add to your slideshow

Word Art
: a way of changing the appearance of text that makes it very colorful or noticeable. this is not always a good thing.


## Presentation Terminology ##

outline
: the general plan for your work, which builds the structure for your presentation.  can also be used for reports, papers, and more.

title
: the name that briefly describes your presentation. Can be direct or catchy, eg. "Cooking Domoda," "Feet of Lightning: How the Bwiam Scorpions Took the League Final"

introduction
: a section of your presentation where you make you and your subject known to the audience. in its most basic form: "hello, I'm _(your name)._ today we'll be talking about _(your topic)_." there are more interesting ways to do this, also; you can use a story about your subject as your introduction, for example
: you can also be _introduced,_ which is having someone else tell the audience who you are

topic
: your subject of discussion.

background
: 1. In your outline: general information, facts, and causes relevant to your
     theme, but are not part of your argument, instructions, or main topics.  
     in a picture of a person, the _background_ is everything behind the person
      -- trees, roads, buildings. it's the information that surrounds, but is
     not, your presentation theme.  
     for example, in a presentation on cooking domoda, information on the 
     health benefits of domoda, or of its expense, would be background
     information.
  2. In PowerPoint: the picture or image that goes under the text or other
     things on your slide

conclusion
: the finish
: the summing-up of your presentation
: a time to tie together all of the information you've shared

call to action
: a part of the conclusion where you urge the audience to do something specific, a single action
: for example, in a presentation on preventing malaria, you might call on your audience to go straight from the venue to a shop and purchase a treated bed net

Q & A / Questions
: after the conclusion of your presentation, a time to take questions from the audience. having a specific time set aside for this means you can ask the audience to wait until the end to ask questions, preventing interruptions.

venue
: the place or location where something happens, in this case your presentation

informal presentation
: an unstructured, unplanned presentation, like telling a friend about that great play in the futbÃ¶l game. usually involves telling a story. the key difference is that an informal presentation is _unplanned._ stories are a good thing.

formal presentation
: a structured, planned presentation, like this class, or a speech, or a television advertisement. usually will have a set venue and audience.  the key difference is that a formal presentation is _planned._ a formal presentation can still "feel" informal, like a conversation.

instructional presentation
: used to _instruct_ -- that is, share a series of steps that accomplish a task
